SELECT u.user_id, u.first_name, u.last_name, b.booking_id, b.start_date, b.end_date: This specifies the columns to be retrieved in the result set:

u.user_id, u.first_name, u.last_name: These columns are selected from the User table (aliased as u) to get the user's identification and name.
b.booking_id, b.start_date, b.end_date: These columns are selected from the Booking table (aliased as b) to get the booking's identification and date range.
FROM User AS u: This indicates that the primary table for the query is User, and it's given a shorter alias u for convenience.

FULL OUTER JOIN Booking AS b ON u.user_id = b.user_id: This is the core of the query, combining rows from the User and Booking tables.

FULL OUTER JOIN: This type of join retrieves all rows from both the left table (User) and the right table (Booking). If there is a match between the tables based on the ON condition, the corresponding columns from both tables are included in the result.
Booking AS b: The Booking table is also given a shorter alias b.
ON u.user_id = b.user_id: This specifies the join condition. Rows from the User table are matched with rows from the Booking table where the user_id column has the same value in both tables.
